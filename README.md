# hotelReservations
This is a Java-based hotel reservation application that I built as part of Udacityâ€™s Java Programming Course. The main goal of the project was to develop a system where users can book and manage hotel room reservations. It was designed to help reinforce core Java programming concepts and strengthen my skills as an aspiring Java developer.
